on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging
or converging, and most are found underwater. For example, a mid-oceanic ridge,
en explained as mantle plumes. These so-called "hotspots", for example Hawaii,
are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the core–mantle
boundary, 3,000 km deep in the Earth. Volcanoes are usually not created where
two tectonic plates slide past one another.
