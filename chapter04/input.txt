Earth's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major, rigid tectonic
plates that float on a hotter, softer layer in its mantle.[1] Therefore,
on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging
or converging, and most are found underwater. For example, a mid-oceanic ridge,
en explained as mantle plumes. These so-called "hotspots", for example Hawaii,
are postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs with magma from the coreâ€“mantle
boundary, 3,000 km deep in the Earth. Volcanoes are usually not created where
two tectonic plates slide past one another.
